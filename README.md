# zebrafish_orthologs
Automated method to find orthologs of human genes in zebrafish.

This is a quick and easy method to find orthologs of human genes in zebrafish based on the working definition of reciprocal best hit (RBH).
The method and scripts are originally from Nicolas Schmelling. I only tweaked them for my application.

The bioRxiv preprint he used this method for: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/14/075291
His protocols.io explaining the method and Terminal commands: https://www.protocols.io/view/reciprocal-best-hit-blast-q3rdym6
